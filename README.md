# VillaEtAl2021Phenotypes
Matlab code for 1D e 2D simulations of the models as described in VillaEtAl2021SIAMJApplMath and VillaEtAl2021VietnamJMath.


**Public gitlab repository VillaEtAl2021Phenotypes**
This repository provides Matlab files to perform simulations as described in:
1. _Modelling phenotypic heterogeneity in vascularised tumours_ by _C. Villa, M.A.J. Chaplain, T. Lorenzi_, published in _SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics_ (2021);
2. _Evolutionary dynamics of vascularised tumours under chemotherapy: Mathematical modelling, asymptotic analysis and numerical simulations_ by _C. Villa, M.A.J. Chaplain, T. Lorenzi_, published in the _Vietnam Journal of Mathematics_ (2021).
For details we refer the interested reader to these publication and to C. Villaâ€™s PhD thesis (to appear online in 2022).

If you use this software in your work then please cite the above named papers, as appropriate.
